### **ES6 Features Used in Paddy - Pet Adoption**  

1. **Arrow Functions (`=>`)** – Used for concise function expressions, making the code more readable.  
   

2. **Template Literals (` `)** – Used for cleaner string interpolation in HTML and dynamic content.  
   

3. **Destructuring (`{}` & `[]`)** – Simplifies extracting values from objects and arrays.  
  

4. **Spread & Rest Operators (`...`)** – Used for copying arrays/objects and handling dynamic function arguments.  

5. **Promises & Async/Await** – Handles asynchronous API calls smoothly for fetching pet data.  
   

6. **Modules (`import/export`)** – Organizes code by separating concerns into different files.  
   

   // main.js
   import { getPetById } from './petFunctions.js';
   ```

7. **Default & Named Parameters** – Used to set default values in functions.
